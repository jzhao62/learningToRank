Train a simple Linear regression model. Given an input vector, output a desired rank. The performance of the model is based on mean square
error between actual rank and predicted rank.

The model is trained in 2 fashion:

1st method: Closed form solution using vector manipulation. This method generate weight in a single step, and does not involve much ML concepts.
2nd method: Stochastic Gradient descend, and a better gradient descent with momentum
